# Student's Choise app

This app will let you play chess in a local area without a chessboard or clock. 

### Game features in general:

- A valid move is performed when a player makes a legitimate chess move
- There should again be a noticeable border around each tile so that no two tiles appear to be merged
- To play, a user must be able to shuff a chess piece to the the destination tile with or without a piece. Moves that are not a valid move must be ignored and should not result in a move.
- A chess clock should be implemented, giving both players each a total amount of time of which they can use a part of that time each move
- The elo rating of a player should be visible

It should look a little like this:
